            A large majority of venue booking sites are exclusive in verbiage, access, and transparency.

            Created an inclusive, all-encompassing, and accessible way for anyone to tour, book, and feel welcome on their journey to finding the perfect venue.

            Through research and the user-centered design process, I found that there was a
            large issue regarding inclusion within the venue industry. Riddled with heteronormative
            language and gender assumptions, not to mention accessibility issues, I felt there was a
            need for a more inclusive version of a booking site. One that enables a person to book
            completely online, with virtual tour options, upfront pricing, and free from exclusive
            language that respects all gender expressions and dynamics. Everyone deserves to have a
            magical day full of love, laughter, and belonging.
